\wDetermining the location of the history...The analysis is complete; the Place of action: city of Mukhosransk.$$$$$\wSo, let's get started. Player, glad to see you in this game. You probably wondered: what will this game be about?$$$$$$\wMmm... let's just say you'll get the answers later...I can only tell you what you will need at the very beginning and from which your brain will remain intact. Your Main Character is an unnamed young man.$$$$$$$\wEverything would be fine and our hero might not get where he ended up... But this happened for two reasons...Firstly, if he had not been in that place, there would not have been this game. And secondly, he had very little money.$$$$$$$$$\wIn any case, one day our hero was passing an old house. Suddenly MC wanted adventure, and he went inside.$$$$$$$\wThere was nothing remarkable inside (here there were no drug addicts or drunks, otherwise the story of MC might have ended before it even started).BUT! when the hero was about to leave the house, he noticed a basement with stone steps leading somewhere in the dark. Next to them on the wall was a sign with the following content:$$$$$$$\w"Wanderer! Since you're here, ask yourself the following question: do you need money? Whatever you answer, you can find everything you need in this basement.$$$$$$$\wIf you are in doubt, I will give you a motivational speech. Where it is 'Who does not pass into the basement, he will die in 5 days'.All right, I won't keep you any longer...‚Äù$$$$$$$\wAfter reading what was written on the sign, MC began to descend...
