That's the kind of conversation I like! That's all, I'm happy, you can pass this door!
You know what I love the most? The clink of coins. You have quieted my passion, now it's my turn to make you happy...
You didn't have to collect the coins. I have enough of them. I just wanted to make you run...
I don't know why you brought that money. When I told you the amount, I was hoping you'd get out of here. Well... Go  where you need to go, while I'm kind!
