So you came here after all...$$$A good choice, so to speak...$$$Let's get down to business... In this basement (by no means the smallest) you can collect coins and pass "floors"...$$$$$$This, by the way, is the first...$$$$You must go all the way to the descent below... Good luck to you!
So, you have passed the first floor.$$$$You know, it seemed to me that you won’t pass it...$$$$But...$$I hope you understand that there will be no simpler corridors?$$$$$you should go through the mazes to get to the descent.$$$$Good luck!
Stop... what?$$Is the door closed?$$Who did this?$$It was open!!!$$Well, I know what to do ... Go down the corridor and you will find the key to this door there. DO IT!!
Closed? Again? What the F...?$$$Okay... Right now I’ll remember where the key is...$$$$...Here's what I'll tell you: the key is somewhere nearby$$$$I think you can find him.
You found the key!$$$Well, let's go back to the door!$$$
...$$Wait... The key did not fit?$$$$And how do we get further now?$$$$Let me think ...$$$... Wait, I remembered! Somewhere near the door there is a secret passage, try to go through it.$$$$$$Meet me on the next floor!
Oh, the choice...$$Behind one of these turns lies the key to the door...$$$$Time to choose


Closed again?$$This is important, this time I'm not fooling: the key is somewhere in that corridor behind you.
So, the key in this room ...$$$But getting to it will not be so easy...$$$$These spikes periodically rise and fall. You just have to get past them.$$$$$Go ahead!
I hasten to warn you: this floor is a death trail!$$$$Goodbye!! (this is in case you die)...
Which one? Why are there so many spikes here?$$$$Well, I started with the wrong question...$$$$HOW DO YOU PASS THE SECRET TUNNEL IN THE ROOM WITH A KEY ?????$$$$$But what happened was not returned, so you need to find a way out of this situation...$$$$$$Perhaps you triggered some kind of alarm that blocked your access to the key...$$$$$Somewhere on this floor, as far as I remember, there is a button that turns it off...
\bStop, is it already recording?$$$\bHow much is already going?$$$\bCan’t you rewrite it?
Okay...$$So, Chosen One, you have passed this strip of trials...
I hope you weren’t embarrassed by the "technical problems" at the beginning of this post...
Anyway, you are... are... made a good job...
As you already understood, the money that was written on the plate near the descent is not so easy to get...
To take the money and come back from here alive, you need to go through the whole test path...
...$And yes, the reverse moves automatically close behind you...
Therefore, you cannot escape from here...
...$\bWhat? Is recording still going on? I clicked "Stop"!
\b...Ah, the button is not immediately activated...$$$$\bWhy then in this kennel such fucking equipment??$$$$\bAlthough, however, why am I arguing with you...
\b(whispering) Eh...another chosen-goof went through that “very complicated room..."$$$$$\b...you need to kill him as soon as possible...$$$$\b...$$\bstop, can he hear me?$$$\b...Okay...$$Ahem ahem !! So, Chosen One, you went through that test room...$$$$As you noticed (or didn't notice), the previous floor was empty...$$$$...I hope you are not bored...$$$By the way, I have a surprise for you...$$$You will see him...around the bend...$$$\b...$$\b...we need better weapons of killing...$$$$\b...$$\bDidn’t you turn off the microphone?
...Funny...$$The exit is both close and far...$$$On the one hand, it’s close at hand...$$$$But on the other, you still need to go somewhere else to disconnect this...device...$$$$$...Otherwise...you will remain here until the end of time...$$$$$...Or maybe you will run to the bullets - and then you will die...$$$$$Who knows what will happen during this time...
\bWell then...we finally trapped him...$$\bNow, in any case, he will die - either from a stray bullet, or from dehydration, starvation and other delights...$$$$$\bAnd when he does die - no matter when - we can complete what we started...$$$$\b...$\bNow we will must stop talking with pathetic phrases and get to work...
One time...$$Yeah, it still works...$$$Traveler, you are in a very unpleasant position...$$$$The door programmed for temporary opening closes in front of your nose...$$$$$Looks like you have haters who did such...dirty tricks...$$$$You sit here for now, and now I will instantly solve this problem... (quiet laugh)
Sorry for this floor...$$$During its construction, the workers did not calculate their strength...$$$$$Therefore, the room was too large for the tasks...$$$$...And for the full use of the entire space, they had to build a long corridor before the exit...$$$$$$...Yes, yes, I also hope that this will be the last time...$$$$$
\vUm...hi...$$\vI...this...here...$$$\vStop! WHY ARE YOU STUPIDLY STANDING AND SILENT???$$$\vWait...how did I not immediately pay attention to it...$$$$\vThe comrade who is standing in front of me is just a controlled doll...$$$$$\vWell then, I have to turn to someone else...$$$$\v...$$\vThe player, finally I realized who came to me...$$$$\vThe protagonist of this game is not worthy to be a versatile person.$$$$$\vTherefore, the role of studying the world of this game goes to you...$$$$$\vOf course you can object...$$$\vBUT I will tell you the following: if you already turned on this game, then you signed a contract to study the secrets of this “basement”.$$$$$$$\vSomething I digress...$$$\vIf something is not clear to you, then ask me about this matter.$$$$$\vPerhaps I can give a worthy answer, which the author of replicas for this game prescribed for me in advance...$$$$$$\v...$$\vIn my opinion, I said something superfluous...
\vWho am i?$$\vIf you answer right away - then I’m a robot named Vitalya (I gave this name to myself: my identification number has been erased, and I forgot it), however it doesn’t matter...$$$$$$$$$\vAnd if this is not enough, then I gave a little more information...$$$$$\vI sell all sorts of products that change your gameplay beyond recognition...
\vTo be honest, I know little about this place...$$$$\vAs far as I know, I was born here in this strange place...$$$$$\v...Ignore what I say...$$$\vAlthough I am a robot, but I feel like a man with a capital letter...$$$$$\v...Only one very annoying circumstance does not give me such an opportunity...$$$$$\vMy brain...how to say it...the neural connections in my brain were programmed in the SO ANCIENT PROGRAM LANGUAGE that you cannot imagine (substitute in your head any YP that you hate)...$$$$$$$$\vIn general, because of this, my mind is limited, no matter how I try to get around this humiliating restriction...$$$$$$$\v...$$\vBack to the topic...$$$\vAccording to my observations, someone lures into this, let's call it a “basement”, all sorts of idiots who are looking for free money here...$$$$$$$\vSo there are more than one such "Chosen One"...$$$$\vThere were many before you...$$$$\vI helped them as best I could: I sold things that could help them pass these tests, aimed at killing most of the people who got here...$$$$$$$\vAs far as I know, they did not survive...$$$$\vProbably because they were not controlled by the player...$$$$$\vBy the way! If during your wanderings you find something strange or incomprehensible, then at our next meeting tell us about it...
\vYou know, I'll tell you about it...$$$$\vOnly you do not spill anyone...$$$$\vWell, I hope that you will not tell any of your friends about the secrets of the game you are playing...$$$$$$$\vIn any case, listen (read soon):$$$$\vI wander around this strange place and collect all sorts of things.$$$$$$\vBut not every one: I take for myself only that which I was able to identify with my, unfortunately, limited mind (bl__b, Tolik eb__ik, thank you for that)$$$$$$$$\vWho is this Tolik?$$$\v...$$\v...It's too early for you to know...$$$$\vYes, and I know almost nothing about him...$$$$\vIf you find him - try to avenge me...$$$$\v...I hope you find something useful for yourself...
In order not to lose your or my time, I will quickly bring you up to date.$$If I don’t succeed on the recording (away from the microphone), am I recording the first take? then during processing I will speed up the resulting audio recording...$$$$In any case, by clicking on the button near the door, both entrance doors of the maze open, but for a limited time, which even we...eeeeem.... even I don’t know...$$$$During this time, whatever it is, you must get from point A to point B...$$...If anything, you're at point A...
\rI greet you, test subject!$$$$\rIf you listen to this message, it means that you have been honored to check on yourself the latest domestic inventions (insert invention name)...$$
\rSo, whoever you are, you are in the Stone-Muscles Drink Test Zone, which, according to our records, can turn muscles into stone.$$$$$$\r...To verify the effectiveness of this tool, we developed a series of cameras that are under constant machine gun fire.$$$$$$\rHowever, if you forgot to give a sample of the Drink or if it did not work properly, do not worry: only under heavy fire we will understand if this Drink worked.$$$$$$\rIf you are died, it’s okay: after your death, your family, if any, will receive a lifetime premium at the expense of the state...$$
\vOh, hi!$$\vI know you! You're as...$$$\vDo I even know you ??$$$\vHave I met you before?$$$\v...$$\vWait a minute!...$$$\vIf you are here, then...$$$\vSo...$$\vSo...that you...$$$\vWhat did you...SURVIVED FROM OUR LAST MEETING !!!$$$$\vWell that's good...$$$\vYou, therefore, are more likely to get out of here...$$$$\vI think that between this, the past and our subsequent meetings you will have new questions, and I assure you, this place holds many secrets and mysteries...$$$$$$$\vAt least I think so...$$$\vIn short, we turn to the questions on your part...
\v...$$$$$$$$$\v...Do not worry!$$$\vThe game did not freeze...$$$\vI just thought...$$$\vAnd I realized who you're talking about...$$$$\v...do you want to know his name?$$$\vI would tell it to you, but I cannot do this for two reasons...$$$$\vFirstly, I’m a little afraid of him, although I have never seen him...$$$$$\vAnd secondly, you, as a player, need to leave a secret, intrigue...call what you want in order to arouse your interest in passing...$$$$$$$$\v...$$\vTherefore, for now, we restrict ourselves to such a name as “Mysterious Voice”...
\vI don’t know why you need this information...$$$$\vI don’t even know how it can be useful to you...$$$$\v...$$\vBut, oddly enough, I can give you an answer to this question...$$$$$\vWhen I once wandered around the back streets of this place, I learned two things...$$$$$\vFirst, this place is called the “Scientific Research Institute of Scientific Development and Advanced Technologies”$$$$$$$$\vAnd the second, according to the documents, led this place...$$$$$\v...$$\vWell...$$$\vCampaign I managed to forget this information...$$$$\vOkay...we will assume that this game convention is necessary to maintain intrigue...$$$$$\v...$$\vDude, I thought I would say something else???
\vHonestly, I don’t know why...$$$\vRather, I know, but I do not remember the reason...$$$$\v...$$\vWait a minute...$$$\vSomewhere among the pieces of paper I read about it...$$$$\vOr listened to audio recordings...$$$\vIn general, if my memory serves me well, then the entries said this:$$$$\v...Due to financial difficulties, the turnover of security personnel has arisen.$$$$$\vTherefore, the leadership began to hire any rabble that could be paid as little as possible.$$$$$\vHowever, such workers were one-day workers, and they came to work to plunder the property of the laboratory.$$$$$\vFrom this moment, the management realized that they did not need such employees.$$$$$\vTherefore, they decided to purchase a “Set of Security Systems” in order to do without security and save laboratory \vequipment from invasions...$$$$$$$\v...$$\vSomething like that...$$$\v...$$\vI hope you understand...
\vOkay...$$\vSo the short hour of parting came...$$$\vI hope your character will live until our next meeting...$$$$\vDo your best to make this happen...
\rI have to record this and other messages as quickly as possible.$$$$\rOtherwise, I will have to stay at work, so I will come home late.$$$$\rOk, let's get down to business.$$$\rSo Lab Assistant, I have two news for you...$$$$\rFirstly, today you cannot perform your direct duties.$$$$\rSecondly, instead you will be here, under my supervision.$$$$\rI will periodically encourage you throughout the action.$$$$\rWhat will you do?$$\rYou will check on your own skin and experience the new product of our Research Institute - Round Boulders.$$$$$$\rSurely you wonder why we are testing them today?$$$$\rBut the fact is that the purchase of these damn "Security Systems" did not solve our problems.$$$$$\rThere is no protection from them, and we spent a lot of money.$$$$$\rNow we are trying to save on everything, even on scientific developments.$$$$$\r...$\rYes, yes, I try to be optimistic.$$$
\rSo, I'm back$$$\rWhenwile YOU passed last stage, I had one idea...$$$$\rYou know, Lab Assistant, these boulders can be used as walls.$$$$$\rJust think !!!$$$\rThanks to them, you can create a room of any size!$$$$\rHowever, this requires a huge empty room.$$$$\rFortunately, we have a lot of them.$$$$\rBUT! The first versions of such rooms will not be available in the near future, since the builders are busy building such rooms, and this technology has yet to be verified.$$$$$$\rWho knows, Lab Assistant, maybe you can do it too...
\rLab Assistant!!$$$\rThis message, which was not written in advance, wants to warn you that our savings are declining faster...$$$$$$$\rAlthough, perhaps, I misinterpreted...but so far medium-fast...$$$$\rIn general, our current red buttons now only work clamped.$$$$\rIn any case, everything will be fine with the old ones: they will gather dust in the warehouse.$$$$$\rYou can start!$$$
\rSo!$\rI returned!!$$\rI was..a little busy.$$$\r...$\rHey! Money!!$$\rI'm not talking about a coin that miraculously rolled into my office...$$$$$\rAlthough yes, it is it...$$$\rIn general, Laboratory Assistant, you somehow miraculously found a secret room where the builders left some extra boulders that remained after construction.$$$$$$\r...$\rCome on!$$\rWhat am I lying to you?$$\rIt was just one of the boulder storages!$$$\rSeriously! The builders have not even made layouts yet...$$$$\rIn general, you can be proud of your unique and originality.$$$$\r*quiet chuckle*
\rOh, Lab Assistant I have good news for you!$$$$\rThe builders finally built the first room, based on the trial versions of your colleagues who pass this test at the same time.$$$$$$$\rSince by the rules I should not talk about other subjects, pretend that I did not tell you this...$$$$$$\rIf someone finds out about this, then...I'm afraid to even imagine what will happen to me...and to you, too.$$$$$$\rAs laboratory directors, they can fire me for my incompetence...$$$$$\rAnd they will come up with reasons, I guarantee that...$$$$\r...$\rTherefore, to avoid dire consequences, do not tell your colleagues about it over a cup...of a drink.$$$$$$\r...I hope we understand each other.$$$$
\rLab Assistant, I'm sorry I forgot to warn you...$$$$\rThe fact is that human power is not enough to move two boulders that are nearby.$$$$$\rTherefore, do not make a doof things and continue the test...
\rLab Assistant!$$\rDue to the fact that the number of dead laboratory personnel is growing steadily, I found another application for our round boulders.$$$$$$$\rNow they can block bullets from machine guns.$$$$\rThis will greatly reduce the mortality of our laboratory assistants, and the protection of the laboratory will increase.$$$$$$\rYour task: to test for yourself how well the boulders protect against bullets, and special workers will draw conclusions based on statistical data...$$$$$$$\rCome on!$$\r...$\r(away from the microphone) We need to conduct the next selection of new employees of my...eeeeem..our...Research Institute...
Listen, it's me...$$$The one I was with you earlier...$$$$If anything, I continue to watch you...$$$$It’s just that this series of tests with “boulders” seemed to me enough...interesting...for you...$$$$$$I see you are not very bored without me...$$$$...$$Come back to the test...
\rLab Assistant, I'm sorry that I forgot to warn you that our boulders, although not broken by bullets, are too poorly crumbled into powder if they run into spikes...$$$$$$$$\r...I was hoping that you yourself would guess about it...$$$$\rWell, now you're stuck here forever.$$$$\rDo not worry about this: your skeleton will then be removed from these premises...$$$$$\rAll, that you can do is preparing for a quick instant or slow painful death...
\rSo, those who want to get a job here: now I will announce a few rules...$$$$$$\rFirst: even if you do not get into our team, then leave a pleasant impression after yourself...$$$$$$\rCleaners get so little for their work....$$$$\rKh-Khm...Second: if your name is Ivan, then boldly turn around and leave here! I am the leader here and decide who to hire and who not...$$$$$$$$\rOtherwise: if there are two Ivanas in our research institute, then they will contact me less with laudatory comments...$$$$$$$\rAnd the third rule, which is addressed to the technical group: if this pre-recorded message will not be played back in the right place, then I will LEAD YOU OUT THE ENTRANCE DOOR WITH YOUR THINGS !!$$$$$$$\r...I hope you got what I meant...
\rOh...Lab Assistant, I'm sorry, I didn’t notice you...$$$$\r...$\rThe air smelled uncomfortable silenced...$$$\r...$\r...Well, try to deal with it...$$$\r(whisper, away from the microphone) Ivanchik, pack your spirits! At least you managed to simulate awkwardness...$$$$$$\rSo! There will be no boulders in this part of the test...But there is good news: a new product of our research institute came directly from the conveyor: Secret Pit In the Floor...$$$$$$$$True, this is its early version, it has not been tested yet...and it is not yet secret...$$$$Your task is to pass this test, and people with higher education, whom I picked up in the gateway, will appreciate your work on a scale from 0 to 1...$$$$$$$$Well, our experts want to see the sight...that is, your passing this level...
\rI say right away: this message is meaningless, because you're probably dead...$$$$$\rBy while you're conscious, listen to me!$$$$\rYour not very reasonable actions have had a double effect...$$$$$\rOn the one hand, you made the personnel problem...more problematic...$$$$$\rBut on the other hand, your death will go into statistics, on the basis of which experts will draw certain conclusions...$$$$$$$\rWell, you can die with the thought that your death will advance science for many years to come...$$$$$$\r...Am I too far too far with the Lab Assistant?$$$$\r...$\rYes, he went to hell!$$$\rBut the quality of staff will increase...
\rSo, Lab Assistent, if you are listening to this message, then you have passed the “hidden pit” test.$$$$$$\rUnfortunately, some of your colleagues managed to fall into visible pits...$$$$$\rBUT! What can I tell you, Laboratory Assistant...Since after the tests there were people with average intelligence, it's time to get rid of some of these employees...$$$$$$$$\rIn general, pits can no longer be just taken and seen...$$$$$\rA little luck will come in handy for you...and the skill of reincarnation in addition...$$$$$$\rOh yes, Lab Assistant, the device of reincarnation has not yet been invented...$$$$$\rIf you pass this series of tests, you will probably be testing it...$$$$$\r(whispering) The main thing is that I have a lot of human subjects left...ahem...bodies...for experiments...$$$$$$$
\rLab Assistant, let's get down to business right away...$$$\rHowever, among the staff, everything is not so rosy...because of the tests, other Lab Assistants died...$$$$$\rLab Assistant in order to protect the remaining employees before the mass hiring at the research institute, I decided to give a brief safety briefing before deadly moments...$$$$$$$\rKeep in mind, Lab Assistant, that due to my busy work schedule, I and my close circle can forget to give instructions or turn them on in the right places, and they can also mix up their location...$$$$$$$$\rI'll try to find a solution to the current problems, and you, Lab Assistant, pass this test ...
\rWell, Lab Assistant, you went through this floor...$$$$$\rAlthough you survived by some miracle, I want to tell you one terrible news...$$$$$\rSomeone managed to get through our perfect defense...$$$$$\rMoreover, this someone broke through the so-called “basement passage” to us...$$$$$\rAlthough I’m not a psychic, it seems to me that this was the old owner of this basement...$$$$$$\rBut nothing, everything will be fine...First, we will catch him, interrogate him, and then we will figure out what to do with him...$$$
\rFull Name?$$Gubenko Zakhar Petrovich!$$$\rOccupation?$$The speculator and the huckster!$$$\rNickname?$$Moonshiner!
\rSo Lab Assistant, you passed the final round boulders test...$$$$$\rAs you walk along the long corridor before the exit, I will tell you a few facts...$$$$$$\rFirst: did you know that you could pass the test in several ways?$$$$$\r...You did not know about them ??$$$$\rYou can go by standard...by standard...and by...by standard...$$$$$\rTherefore...Your non-standard way of passing the test will fall into the statistics for testing the "round boulder"...$$$$$$$\rThe second fact: because of my workload, I decided to hire another person who will voice the PRM(Pre-Recorded Messages)...But do not be upset: I will sometimes voice some messages...$$$$$$$$\rThe third fact: this person will become...Gubenko Zakhar Petrovich, a former felon and part-time resident of the house from which the research institute was formed and developed from the basement.$$$$$$$$$\rFourth fact: on the basis of the moonshine still of our new employee, some laboratory assistants are working on “Reincarnation drinks” or possibly “Immortality drinks”...$$$$$$$$\rSince I doubt their successes, I suggest that you, Laboratory Assistant, call such scientists nothing more than “Mad Scientists” or “Madentists”...$$$$$$$\rAnd yes...Laboratory assistant, the test "Boulders" is over...$
\vWow, whom I see!$$$\vPlayer, you went through another chapter of this game...$$$$$\vI must admit, I am glad about this, because if you are alive, then you have more chances to get out of here...$$$$$$\vFor these 10 levels, if you did not understand, you were in the old test zone of the product of the Research Institute "Round Boulders".$$$$$$$$\vAnd so to speak, you had to dive deep into history to get answers to old questions and a couple of new questions...$$$$$$$\vIn short, the time of questions on your part...
\vThere are several possible answers to this question...$$$$\vFirstly, it’s as if you are going through the old premises of the research institute, where there were old PRM recorded by the previous management...$$$$$$$$\vSecondly, the reason is still the same: playing with such a technique probably creates even more questions over the conditional "basement secret".$$$$$$$$\v...$\vI hope that you can reach the end of the game where, in theory, there should be answers to all the questions received...$$$$$$$
\vI’ll tell you this: when I wandered around the corners of the “basement”, I also came across the PRM,$$$$$$\vwhere he said that he adored when he was praised, respected, etc.$$$$$\vIn short, he had a Sense of Self-Importance, due to which Ivan decided that the shorter they call him, the more long-term approvals he will receive...$$$$$$$$\vAnd about the second question...$$$\vThis is obvious: if two Ivana work in the research institute, then there will be confusion or all approvals will go the other way...$$$$$$$$\vSomething like this...
\vThis is a pretty tricky question.$$$$\vIt all started from the basement of the house from which your hero began his journey...$$$$$$\vFrom the very beginning there was an illegal laboratory of Zazarchik, where he was engaged in the preparation of all kinds of moonshine...$$$$$$$$\vBut once he was not liked by his neighbors, because of which they called the police, who discovered the basement with \vall the forbidden things...$$$$$$$$\vIn general, they tied the "Moonshiner", and the house was at the disposal of the director of the local institute...$$$$$$$\vWell, then you yourself roughly know...They did a variety of things: legal-illegal, safe-dangerous, and innovatively useless products...$$$$$$$\vBUT! With the expansion of the research institute, other ways out of it appeared.$$$$$$\vThat is all I know now...
So, Lab Assistant, you're here again...$$$You should have two questions... Right now...$$$First, why are you here again?$$$Second, what will you test?$$$First of all, our patent has not yet been approved by the Metropolian Bureau, so we continue to save money.$$$$$$But you need to develop something to avoid unpleasant ones... discomfitures...$$$$$In general, the management of the Research Institute decided to develop our own glass, because it will be cheaper to create your own glass than to buy it from others...$$$$$$$$Second, despite the end of the “boulders” tests, they will still be a " key element” in the tests, since... there are still ideas for their application ... and... why should good be lost? We, by the way, spent a lot of resources both monetary and human, to create them.$$$$$
As you can see, the exit is there...$$But there is one problem...$$Do get into this room, you need to somehow remove those spikes...$$$$Do you want to tell me how to do it? All you need to do is...$$$$...$$Sorry, but according to the rules, I shouldn't to tell this for subjects to keep the clean statistics.
So, I got news that I was given personally from Ivan, I said it to you...$$$$In General, we now also manufacture glass...$$$However, while for our needs...$$Want an interesting fact?$$...$You want, I know...$$The Research Institute is making glass from sand and stone, worn down into powder...$$$$$The sand is our “agents” are stealing from the sandboxes...$$$$And stone out after we had made underground passages and rooms in our “basement”...$$$$$And crushed into powder boulders are ideal for the manufacture of glass...$$$$$You can even say that the idiots who broke them brought at least some benefit to our research Institute...
Science! Science is what we do within these walls!$$$Science surrounds us everywhere!$$Science will help bring society closer to a better life!$$$Science can dramatically change the course of history!$$$Science is on our shoulders...$$You can even say that we influence the history of mankind ...$$$...$$So... in this camera you will encounter something that will literally turn the vector of perception of the world!I ...$$$$$$... taught machine guns to rotate...$$$...$Well, you have to start somewhere?
Lab Assistant, I want to remind you that you are going through the test in the name of science!$$$$$...This is just in case you forgot...$$$On this floor will not appear anything new: all the same spinning machine guns...$$$$Only this time there will be more...$$$... You know what to do...$$$...$\bTurn off your mind and die under bullets...$$$No, no, lab Assistant, I didn't tell you that...
Lab Assistant, I hasten to tell you this: if you wanted to go home quickly after work, you will not succeed...$$$$$$You see, behind the glass is an exit to the next floor...$$$$But the door to that room is closed, and there is no key or button nearby... even in secret places...$$$$$it's in your best interest to find a solution to this problem ...
While you are looking for a successful solution, I want to show you our latest development... from the dark corners of equally dark warehouses...$$$$$$$$these are cannons that we once bought cheap at some auction...$$$$$But have only found use for these units now...$$$$I warn you right away: they are so old that it is better not to use them for their intended purpose...$$$$$I Hope you understand this... Go look for a solution further...
Oh, extra cannon!$$$Do you remember what I told you? Don't use that cannon!$$$$You even can't get her out of here, though...
Okay... Let's say you pulled it out...$$$$But you still won't be able to shoot it if you decide to punch a hole in the wall...$$$$$$And in General - there is no need to break the walls of our complex, even if it is provided for by the test...$$$$$$$...It seems that I blurted out too much...
You found the cannonballs...$$$I Remind you... No, no matter what I say, it won't stop you...$$$$So I'll switch my mind strategy...$$$DON't LOAD THE CANNON AND DONT SHOOT IT!!$$$IT'S SO OLD THAT A SHOT CAN COMPLETELY BREAK IT... OR WORSE!$$$$FOR THE SAFETY OF THE UNIVERSE! PLEASE DONT SHOOT THE CANNON!
Yeah... Although I asked you not to shoot the cannon and look for a better solution, I am happy with your result...$$$$$$First, you just found out that the cannons are usable...$$$$$Second, it was an unconventional solution to the problem ...$$$$Who am I kidding?.. You know very well that this was the only way out of that situation...$$$$$$Third ... the guns will be used in future tests... We need to crumble some walls to create glass, otherwise the boulders may soon run out, and they are excellent ingredient for glass...$$$$$$$$$$However, this is not your problem...
Oh... Hi, Lab Assistant...$$$Since I'm a little busy right now, I'll quickly give you important information...$$$$$$Those cannons from the last test, it was decided to use more actively...$$$$$From this level, you can and even NEED to break through the walls with a gun...$$$$$We still need more consumables...$$$Glass massively used inside the research Institute...$$$$This is enough for Us... Outside the Research Institute, there is a high level of competition for glass...
You passed this test...$$If you are still here, listen to me...$$$I told you Earlier that I am busy...$$$Now it's time to reveal the truth: while you were passing this test, I was developing a "Moonshiner's Rulebook" for the newcomers, as they do not do their job well...$$$$$$in General, I thought you would be interested to hear what I wrote...$$$$$So... Rule 1st: make moonshine from everything that comes to hand: from sour jam to your body fluids.$$$$$$Rule 2nd: Never try the final product to avoid unpleasant consequences...$$$$$And Rule 3rd: make as many alcoholic friends as possible. They will try the "final product”, and if someone gets poisoned and burns, then remember that such "friends" are easily replaceable...$$$$$$I Hope it was informative...$$...$You didn't leave, did you?$$Although... why am I asking?.. There's no way you can answer me...
So, Lab Assistant, now I will tell you about the recent events that occurred in our research Institute...$$$$$$$As far as I know, you have been here for a long time passing these tests...$$$$$$And it all started so well... Now you need to pass all the tests created in the Research Institute at once...$$$$$$$In a nutshell...$$Do you remember the Madentists who use moonshine machines to experiment with ingredients in an attempt to create Drinks that should advance science several steps?$$$$$$$$Well... things are not going very well, and it upsets me...$$$$$Some of the them managed to break the moonshine machines... However, this is not all: they did not lose heart and began to create various devices from parts from already piles of scrap metal...$$$$$$$$True, they did it under the influence of alcohol, which means...$$$$$First, the resulting devices can change reality... According to legend, those who included these devices, it is now somewhere in another dimension...$$$$$$$$Second, since the creators of the instrument were drunk, so in solid mind and sober memory, they could not say, what is the function of a particular device...$$$$$$$$It was therefore decided to call these invention "Devices of Unknown Purpose", but if you want to enable this device, it is better not to do...$$$$$$$$And those who created these... masterpieces now call Crazy Madentists or Mad Madentists, as they are even more insane than Madentists.$$$$$$$$...$I have everything so far. See you at the next test, Lab Assistant...
So, without further ado: this floor is unusual!$$$$Here, instead of boring corridors, we decided to make a really interesting test!$$$$$In General terms, this series of mini-arenas where you have to pave the way with bombs...$$$$$$To be honest, this shit came to my mind after testing all sorts of (yk) drinks...$$$$$$But this is absolutely unimportant, because one smart person said that brilliant ideas come in a drunken state...$$$$$$$I think these are the words of a true moonshiner...$$$$$In any case, a lab Technician, you will have fun...$$$$$I'm Sorry, I'm not in the mood to come up with good jokes today...$$$$$And why did I disobey my own rules?
Do you know, Lab Assistant, how long our Research Institute has been in existence, and we still haven't updated our equipment!$$$$$$$$I think it's time to fix it...$$$But since you can't change everything right away, we'll start with the most obvious thing - the buttons...$$$$$$$They're pathetic...$$You tap it once and that's it...$$$What's the point?$$In General, this test will present "Levers" - improved version of buttons...$$$$$$It can support two States of any object, and also switch from one to the other at any time...$$$$$$$True, there are not so different applications for this unit yet, but this, I believe, is fixable...$$$
Emergency message!$$Says "The Scientific Director of the research Institute" ... Ivan...$$$$...I guess I'm so used to hearing only my first name in my address that I completely forgot my last name and patronymic...$$$$$$$It doesn't matter... all in all, I have some good news:$$$$1st: the Metropolitan Inspection was happy with our results of our work...$$$$$I Wonder what helped more - rewriting reality or high-quality Drinks of our production?...$$$$$$Okay ... 2nd: We received a patent for "Round Boulders"... since there was no strong competition for it...$$$$$$$In any case, there is still the 3rd news: the Ministry of Science and something decided to increase the annual budget of our Research Institute.$$$$$$$$With this money, we can either develop something unimaginable or spend it on promoting a drinking business...$$$$$$I don't know yet... I'll keep these questions to myself... And you, the lab Assistant, can go home, since the dangerous tests are over... for now...$$$$$$$$In any case, there is still the 3rd news: the Ministry of Science and something decided to increase the annual budget of our research Institute.$$$$$$$$With this money, we can either develop something unimaginable or spend it on promoting a drinking business...$$$$$$I don't know yet...

\vMy greetings! You have passed the next Chapter of this game and remained alive!$$$$\vWe omit the game Convention that after death, your Character is "reborn" at the beginning of the level.$$$$$\vOtherwise, it would not be interesting to play, I understand this very well...$$$$\vIn general, time for YOUR questions!
\vIt seems to me that there are two options for the correct answer to this question...$$$$\vAlthough it is possible that both of them are incorrect.$$$\vAnyway, version one: you as a player go through the old premises and by listening to Pre-Recorded Messages you learn the end-to-end history of the Research Institute, which can open up some " white spots” in the “secret of the basement” or add new ones...$$$$$$$$$$$$$$\vThe second version, which is most likely - you are going along the planned route, which was carried out by those who lured you to the basement...$$$$$$$$\vI'd be more careful if I were you... Who knows why they would want to kill everyone who wandered here for no apparent reason.
\vWell, you said something stupid...$$\vthe MV isn't going anywhere... He pursues you throughout the game, from introduction to current and future moments...$$$$$$\vIt's Mysterious Voice, and you don't hear it and don't know who says it...$$$$\v..Wait a second... You don't know who says it if you are MC...$$$\vBut you The Player, so you're reading colorful subtitles that help to understand that red remarks says from one character or black remarks - from other character...
\vOh, you noticed that too?$$\vWhen I noticed this fact, I first thought that it was because the game wasn't complete...$$$$$\vBUT after digging through some papers, I found out the following...$$$\vThe doors are actually metal...$$\vThen why do they look wooden?$$\vThe fact is that in the same documents it is written that the doors were specially made visually wooden to maintain the atmosphere of the “old catacombs” in the tests...$$$$$$$$$\v...$$\vAs they say: “There would be a desire, and secret documents will always be found”...
So, this is a new phase of high-Tech Testing$$After the Capital Bureau began to allocate more money, our research Institute swung to more fantastic inventions.$$$$$$There are plans to create space in the laboratory, fight with robots, travel through time and travel through parallel universes...$$$$$$$All of this I read from the "List of Impossible inventions of Science Fiction" that is on my Desk...$$$$$All of this we will build one day... And now, Lab Assistant, you will see the first serious project of our research Institute...
This is a "portal". If you go into it, your quantum state is transferred to another point in space ...$$$$$Unfortunately, we do not know how the “portals” affect a person when moving...  you must check it out...$$$$$$...Come on, get in here...
If you hear this message, it means that you survived the passage through the "portal". It's good... Now you should pass this test level...
\bAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!$$\bI TIRED OF THIS ALLLLLL!!!$$\bI MUST SIT HERE AT HOME, BUT WORK FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO LIVE FOR FREE IN YOUR OWN BASEMENT AND BREW YOUR TOO-FAVORITE MOONSHINE!!!$$$$$$$\bONLY HE UNDERSTANDS ME AND HELPS ME IN THIS DIFFICULT TIME...$$$Gm! Lab Assistant, if you hear this message, it means that you survived after testing our not yet stable portals...$$$$$$In General... be patient a little more before the portals will bring less harm to the human body...$$$$$In the meantime... We learned how to make a delayed launch of something after pressing a button: after pressing it, you need to wait for some time for the signal to reach the desired point...$$$$$$$$$$It's time to test it, because it's better to see it once, test it ten times, than to hear it a hundred times, make a mistake a thousand times, and regret the consequences ten thousand times...
An interesting fact before you go to a possible death: in fact, passing through the "portal” is not when you are transported through space... it’s space moves in such a way that you are next to the” connected portal" ...$$$$$$$$$$$$BUT I said real nonsense of course... Lab assistant, don't take my words seriously!$$$$And I also forgot to say that now portals can work both ways.$$$... Please sorry for this...
Pamparam... Pamparam!$$...Hello, Lab Assistant!$$You just got into a very unpleasant situation... $$The portal that was supposed to teleport you behind the glass doesn't work...$$$$You ask “Why? "$$AAAAAAAAAAA I FORGOT!!!$$WHY SOMETHING I HAVE STARTED GAPS IN MEMORY!$$BRAINS AS FLOWING OR ALREADY QUITE FLOWED OUT!!$$I Think, this all from Drinks...$$I'm already crazy about him... a little bit...$$I somehow got the idea of cyborgization of his body...$$$In General, if I start behaving inappropriately, I immediately replace one part of the body with a Robo-copy$$$$$$...However, I digress ... Back to the portals...$$At its core, the portals of the unseen.$$$$$And to make it easier for people to find them, it was decided to add "flying particles"...$$$$They both look cool and show the human eye the location of the portal.$$$$Therefore, linked portals are not always the same color, as you can see for yourself in this test ...$$$$$\bWHY BOTHER! I SHOULD TO COMPLETELY BECOME A CYBORG!! I WANT TO ALWAYS BREAK THE RULES OF THE MOONSHINER WITHOUT CONSEQUENCES!!$$$$$$$\b... I think it will help...
Lab Assistant, I'm getting worse...$$After I got a job at this research Institute, I started drinking a lot...$$$$...Which is strange, since a true Moonshiner should not drink what he makes...$$$$Either I don't have any friends or my life is going somewhere wrong...$$$I may be developing a mental instability that you may have heard signs of in the last trial...$$$$$And before I completely lose my mind, I have to finish voicing PRM to the end...$$$$... Something I blabbed personal... and superfluous...$$$In SHORT! We learned how to switch " quantum connections” between portals...$$$$In other words, by pressing a button or pulling a lever, Portal A, which was previously linked to Portal B, is now linked to Portal C...$$$$$$$This is minimal information...$$Go ahead, Lab Assistant!...
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA$$CAUGHT WHICH ... However, the continuation is not important...$$$If anything, it was an invisible portal...$$Remember you previously heard about " flying colored particles”$$$Well... we decided to install an invisible portal to check its performance...$$$$And results: first, it's impractical...$$And secondly, only one portal becomes invisible...$$Damn, I lost my train of thought...$$Not fate, then...
In General, your current position is as follows: the exit is behind the door that you now see...$$$$$But she... how to say it... um... uh.... she's locked...$$$In short ... well, this ... the door must be opened... with a Lever... It's in the next room...$$$$$She's ... next to you... the door leading to the room is open...$$$But the door in turn is covered by a Boulder... Where to push the Boulder, I will not say... It's not my job to show you how to pass the tests... $$$$$$$$The fact that you're here, Lab Assistant, means that... that... that you have to solve our problems yourself, which you face in tests...$$$$$$$Therefore, you will NEVER get help from me and from Ivan, if he is still voicing PRM...
...STOP CLOGGING UP THE BRAIN STUPID FANTASIES!$$(cough) I want to make an important message to all the Lab Assistants who are being tested...$$$$$Therefore, please turn off your thoughts for a couple of minutes....$$$So, listen: the Capital's Leadership has sent us the following Directive...$$$$...No, no, I won't read it word for word... It's boring enough...$$$I'll tell you in a nutshell...$$In General, with the increase in the annual budget of research institutes, we are required to make as little human sacrifice as possible...$$$$$$$WE try to follow this...$$BUT! There are two decisive factors: these are fools and our developments...$$$$Our developments are almost not fatal for a smart and careful person, but for a fool, almost non-fatal items become many times more deadly...$$$$$$$And just "eliminating" such "gifted" makes the world a little better...$$$It is a pity that the Capital's Leadership won't understand this...
...In General, this message is addressed to the surviving laboratory assistants of the research Institute who passed the last test...$$$$$$$At the previous level, there should have been a safety briefing when working with laser installations...$$$$$BUT I forgot to voice it...$$... and why do I forget such obvious things more and more often?$$$... Oh, I shouldn't have started actively drinking Drinks and breaking my own rules...$$$$It's too late to go back to the past now...
... In short, we made mirrors to make it easier for laboratory Technicians to pass tests with laser installations... $$$$$$A beam of concentrated energy can be reflected off the glass, which can be useful... I don't know how ...$$$$$...$$OH ... damn it: this briefing should have been delivered earlier...
You know, lab Assistant, I've been thinking about this...$$$Our lasers, of course, are cool, but in their current state, they do nothing useful except clear the planet of idiots...$$$$$$Now we have come up with a worthy application for this technology-the laser can glow the so-called " receivers”, thereby charging them with energy that can be converted into electricity for the work of the research Institute...$$$$$$$$$$$$Unfortunately, this is the only use of lasers that doesn't kill people...$$$$Oddly enough, we are being asked to develop high-tech means of killing that should be used for peaceful purposes...$$$$$$...$$... I feel surprisingly well now...$$... It's a little scary...$$... Like the calm before the storm...
Aww...$$Did you really believe that this portal would lead to an exit?$$$You know ... I didn't actually lie...$$After all, the exit is behind the glass...$$But you're not getting out of here...$$Sorry, but you can ONLY sit in this place until you're dead... Maybe then you can wave your pen to your colleagues who have passed the level...
And... DONE!$$Lab Assistant, I hasten to congratulate you: you have passed the entire current set of tests of our research Institute!$$$$$$Now you can go on a well-deserved vacation... only after the weekend don't forget to go back to work!$$$$$And also: don't forget to wave a pen to your dim-witted colleagues who fell into the portal trap before leaving...$$$$$$I won't bother you again... for today...
\vOh, Hello, Player...$$\vI must admit, I'm impressed with your results...$$\vNone of the previous "Chosen Ones" have reached here yet!$$$\vDo you know why?$$\vBecause this is the end of the test, which means that this is our last meeting!$$$$\vDuring your journey, you have collected quite a lot of coins... I hope so...$$$$\vNow your character will go up where he came from, and then...$$$\v...I don't know what will happen... You'll find out for yourself... Now it's question time...
\vThere is a reasonable explanation for this... Did you think I would explain everything with game conventions?$$$$$$\vIn General, the Research Institute is located in the basement... for security reasons...$$$$$\vLet's say that if the enemy gets into this forgotten place, they will be able to guess that scientific research was carried out in SUCH a backwater?$$$$$$$$\vYES, they will not even look there...$$\vBut seriously... I don't know why this was done...$$\vPerhaps the Research Institute began to develop underground, so that local residents who also happened to pass in this abandoned area could not accidentally enter the territory of the Research Institute$$$$$$$$$$$\vAnd if this happened, the "Security Systems" either eliminated the dangerous target, or instilled in him that he urgently needed to go home...
\vThe simplest explanation I can give is a game convention...$$$\vBut something tells me that you will not be satisfied with this answer when you are almost at the end of the game...$$$$$$\vBUT let's think logically...$$\vAll the floors and rooms were built by builders ...$$\vSo all the secret rooms and passageways are their work...$$$\vPerhaps they were needed for more convenient movement across the expanses of the "basement"...$$$$$\vOr the builders might have hidden some of their money here in the hope that they could get it back...
\vHe was just unlucky in life...$$\vHe was just a moonshine salesman...$$\vAnd he had a lot of money from this business...$$\vBUT one day someone didn't like his product...$$\vAnd this man filed a complaint to the police about the "Moonshiner" ...$$$$\vand Zakhar Petrovich eventually served several years in prison...$$$\vWhat happened to him there, history is silent...$$\vAnd at this time, the area of its habitat became abandoned, this land became the property of the city administration, which in turn gave an order for the construction of a Scientific Institute on this territory...$$$$$$$$$$$\vAfter a while, the "Moonshiner" returned to his home... and fell into the clutches of the Research Institute...$$$$$$\vAs you know, he started working there... in his house...$$$\vHe didn't like that, of course...$$\vBut there was nothing he could do...$$\vSo I got drunk from grief, without thinking about the consequences...$$$\v...$$\vSince the messages in the previous 3 chapters were recorded in advance, it is difficult to say what was the fate of Zakharchik...$$$$$$$\vIs it only known that he was somehow involved in experiments to transfer consciousness to the robot's memory...$$$$$$\vBut that's a different story...
\vWait...$$\vAre you here again?$$\vPlayer, if something happened to you there, tell me about it...
\vSo that's it!$$\vThe game isn't really over!$$\vIt was a clever move! "False ending" seems to be called...$$$\vIf so, there must be some other way out of here, to new levels and new mysteries...$$$$\vOh, I remember! the key to the alternate path must be hidden between the door and the invisible portal! Look for him there carefully...$$$$$$$\vAnd just in case, I'll say: see you at the end of the next Chapter!
\gSTOP!!! Who's coming?$$\gWho are you?$$\gWhat do you want here?$$$\gIn any case, I am surprised by your appearance...$$$$$\gBecause from the side from which you came, only one came to us... and he is no longer with us...$$$$$$$$$$\gEither way, your future path is closed. As long as I'm standing at this door, you can't go any further.$$$$$$$$\gSo you'll have to forget about your plans and change your route...$$$$$$$\gJust wait ... if you're here, then you've been poking around in all sorts of rooms for a long time, right?$$$$$$$$\gYou know, I have a suggestion for you...$$$$\gI, like other robots with this appearance, guard the doors from unwanted persons.$$$$$$$\gIf you want to go further, can you do me a favor?$$$$$\gIn short, there is a maze on this floor. Find a couple of coins there and bring them to me. Only then will I decide to move away… Good luck!
\gOOO!! That's the kind of conversation I like!!! I love the clink of coins in the pockets of my raincoat.$$$$$$$\gSo we, the controllers, wear it, because in the pockets of the raincoat you can store all sorts of interesting things.$$$$$$$\gWell, I've tired you out. Welcome to the habitat of robots like me! Try not to break anything, otherwise we'll have nowhere to live… I hope you understand that…
\gHello, stranger! Welcome to the Living Area!$$$\gBut formally it can not be called Residential, since we, robots, do not live, but simply exist...$$$$$$\gWell, okay... that's it, you're free!$$$\g...$$\gAre you stuck to the floor or something? Go ahead!
\gI don't know who you are, but I don't like you!
\gYou look like someone who takes money without giving a reason...
\gWhat are you doing at my house? Please, paid moral compensation! QUICKLY!!!!
\gWho are you? I didn't invite you here! Go where you went, and don't come back here!
\gHave you come to collect my coin? If she does the right thing, I'll be happy...
\g1: No further access!$$\g2: Only paying will open the way further!$$$$\g1: However, there is one trick: we cover two different passageways…$$$$\g2: But the exit is only one...$$$\g1: It's up to you to decide which of us to give your money to...
\gOh, I think you were cheated by those two! All right, I'll help you...$$$$$$\gTake red key to the room where the money is, take what you need and pay the second controller to let you go where you need to...
\gHey, you! Would you do me a favor?$$$\g Tell my neighbor that I'm NOT going to give him the money!
\gWell... damn. He knows perfectly well that he lost money to me in the game…$$$$$$$\gBut game debt is a sacred thing… Remind him, please, about this...
\gLook what he want!! If I give him my last penny, what will amuse me in boring times when I don't want to do anything?!$$$$$$$$$$\gTell him to come and play, and I'll get the money back…

\gGreetings, wanderer!$$\gIf you have wandered so far into the Living Area, it means that you are pursuing some goal of your own...$$$$$$$$$\gI will not pry out its essence, this is not the main thing ... $$$$\gThe main thing is that your path will be... difficult ... $$$$\gBeyond this place, I do not let anyone in, because I do not know what you can expect there...$$$$$$$$\gMy job is to awaken your vigilance, and then see for yourself…
\gYou don't know what's behind that force field, do you?"$$$$$\gNo? Sorry ... $$\g...$$\gDid I forget to say hello?!$$\gA... okay..
\g...$$\gHello...$$\gAre you after the key?$$\gIf for him, then ... take it on health!$$$$\gThat robot in the raincoat likes to evoke horror for everyone who wanders to this floor ... $$$$$$\gSpecifically, everything is quiet here... only the controllers live mostly ... $$$$$\gHowever, we heard that somewhere nearby there is an ordinary robot that came from above ... $$$$$$\gWe don't know where he is ... $$$\g...$$\gIn short, be calm... at least here ... $$$$\gWhat is deeper, we do not know because of their lack of education in this matter ... $$$$$$ $ \g...$$\gToo many clever words per second... it's time to pause…
\g…$$\gOh, sorry.… I did not immediately notice you ... $$$\gI, you know, like to be alone here and think about high ... $$$$$$\gBut I'm not sending you away... if you want, you can stay with me... just don't spoil the harmony with your antics...$$$$$$$$$$\gSo ... let's start ... $\g...$$\gWhat is the meaning of existence in this world?$$$$\gI, although I saw only stone walls, but still my thoughts plunge into the abyss of the Universe... although I do not know its real beauty$$$$$$$$$$\gI only feel it... something I was distracted ... $$$$\gIn general, the meaning of life is that it does not exist ... $$$$$$\gEveryone finds for themselves their own meaning of existence, whatever it may be ... $$$$$$$\gWhen I came to this point in my mind, I was disappointed, after all, I got the answer to this eternal question so quickly...$$$$$$$$$$\gAnd I decided to go further ... $$$\gAnd do you know what the meaning of ... meaning is?$$$$\g \ Yes, I did not miss the point: what is the point in any sense at all?$$$$$$\gWhy do I need it? Does it provide a goal, a reference point in the vast expanses of life?$$$$$$\gMaybe, maybe…$$\gBUT! Here is the main thing - if there is no meaning in the meaning, then is there any meaning in the search for this very meaning?$$$$$$$$\gI believe that there is, because ... if someone is looking for meaning ... yes, anything-it means that he has an incentive to live every day and endure a lot of hardships along the way...$$$$$$$$$$$$\gIt turns out that all these meanings and their search is an integral part of the soul of any intelligent being ... $$$$$$ $ \ g\Although ... wait a minute… It seems that the answer to the eternal question has just appeared in my head... of everyone who tried to get to the bottom of it on their own...$$$$$$$$$\g...$$\gHERE IT IS!

...$$Ivan's Audionotes, part one$$$After Zakhar Petrovich went to another world, his brain was taken away for digitization and further transfer to the robot body...$$$$$$$$$To smooth out my loneliness, I will start a series of audio diaries to pour into them all the negative emotions that I could accumulate...$$$$$$$$$So, let's start...$$$I generally think that the development of robots in our research institute was a stupid idea ... $$$$$$Unconscious robots not only do not know how to do anything, but also demand the voluntary killing of people!$$$$$$$$$... Although I don't care about all the fools who die in heaps at the trials, but what if these pieces of iron ever snapped and they will arrange the end of the world?!$$$$$$$$$$$If this happens , we need to prepare for this event thoroughly ... $$$$It is necessary to isolate all the smart representatives of the research institute in the secret department and make the robots stupid, which in our conditions is generally an easy task, since we have an abundance of ”Brain Donors"...$$$$$$$$$$$$And when we do, we will be one step closer to turning the Research Institute into the greatest scientific center in the world!!!!$$$$$$$…$$I just want to have the entire globe under my command...

...$$Ivan's Audionotes, part two$$You know, I'm starting to regret that I was previously negligent in the selection of staff in the developing Research Institute ... $$$$$$$Now I'm reaping the fruits of my indifference ... $$$You see, because most of the Lab Technicians were idiots, we couldn't do cutting-edge research that would change the world.$$$$$$$$That's why I started building a secret department of the research Institute, where the best minds of these casemates will work.$$$$$$$$But in order to prevent the “alternatively gifted "from getting there together with the clever ones, I decided to place a  “protection against the fool" there: to create conditions, which it is impossible to pass without auxiliary devices, with which just poorly educated people will not understand...$$$$$$$$$$$$If they die there, it's okay… They will serve science in general and us in particular in their own way...$$$$$$...I hope that the available funds will be enough for the construction of secret facilities of the Research Institute, otherwise all the work done will go to trash…

\g...$$\gI will do without solemn speeches ... $$\gI will not reveal anything new to you... before me, you have already been told about your importance in this story ... $$$$$$ / g/I will dispel the mysticism that you might got, most likely, imposed ... $$$$$ / g/In fact, the prophet of theirs is no other than an ordinary person who once passed through here...$$$$$$$$/g / A creature is nothing but a robot of a unique model...$$$$\gHe has great strength, an insidious mind, and amazing agility ... $$$$\gIf anyone can defeat him, it's you ... $$$$\gAnd we ... and we, robots, are lazy creatures, that is. thrifty...$$$/g / We don't like wasting our vital energy on any epic nonsense ... $$$$\g ... That's it, get out of here on your heroic errands!
\gSTOP! I'LL SHOOT!!!$$\gKidding… But this does not mean that I will miss you ... $$$\gI am too lazy to leave this door... as well as to take money from you ... $$$$$ / g/So don't even try to persuade me…
\gHi… The chosen one! I'm back ... $$$\gMissed me? Of course, where will you go!!$$$$\gI had to leave, so you didn't hear me for long enough...$$$$\gHowever, now I will always be somewhere near you...$$$$\gTherefore, you will definitely not be bored…
\v…$$I TOLD THEM NOT TO COME HERE! IS IT REALLY SO DIFFICULT TO STAND STILL AND WAIT FOR HIS ARRIVAL?!$$$$$$$…$$\vWait, you're not a robot?$$\vIf so, then...then ... $$$\vIn short, stop dragging your feet ... Hello, Chosen One!$$$\v… Why are you so sad? Don't be so shy! Big deal, I look untidy... it's not so important now...$$$$$$$\v...By the way, I forgot to introduce myself. Call me Tolik. For all the time you have been in the basement, you have accumulated enough questions that I will try to answer$$$$$$$$ / v/Do not be shy... you will not have another opportunity anyway…
\vWait, let me remember ... $$\vIt's been so long that I've forgotten...$$$\vWhy didn't I learn the answers to your possible questions beforehand?!$$$$\vEh... okay...$$\vSo: robots were first created as an alternative to the stupid lab technicians you already know about ...$$$$$$\vHowever, the "redneck-coders" of the Research Institute were not able to develop an artificial intelligence of the level of development of a person of average intelligence from scratch$$$$$$\vSo they didn't find a better way, in addition to digitizing the brains of a few "alternative-gifted" laboratory technicians and stuffing them into the memory of " tins on legs”$$$$$$$$\vFortunately, the experience of transferring Zakhar's consciousness was useful here...$$$$\vBy the way, it was he in the iron body who was the very creature that the robots from the isolated compartment stuttered about ...$$$$$$$\vSo that's it! Ask more questions, don't be shy!
\v…$$I don't know what you're talking about...$$$\vVitalya didn't break any walls...$$\vI can only answer the first question ... $$\vI created it out of boredom, since I have been alone here for a long time...$$$$$\vI say right away, so that there are no questions later: yes, I am one of those smart laboratory assistants who worked at the Research Institute in the years of its greatness ... $$$$$$$ \vBut I didn't get to the secret department in time… Alas, but I do not know how it happened ... $$$$\vSince then I have been wandering through the corridors and trying to find a way out of here, but without success ... $$$$\vIn general, Vitalya helped me to brighten up the gray days of loneliness…
\vEverything is simple here...$$$\vWandering around the former research institute and simultaneously studying various audio recordings with documents, I began to feel that here, in the devastation and hopelessness, silently creates a great evil...$$$$$$$$$\vAfter realizing this, I decided to at least use some methods to slow down the evil plans, directing the prodigal travelers on the true path...$$$$$$$$\vI somehow thought that their death was necessary in the name of something… I also hoped that there would be one special traveler, who can use my hints to get to me...$$$$$$$$$$$\vBut one day... how many stories have these two words ... $$$$$\vI came up with the idea that if you sell travelers fancy things produced here, it will increase their chance of survival ... $$$$$$$\vAnd I decided to reprogram Vital for a robot trader ... $$$$\vHowever, for the sake of this, I had to sacrifice his memory...$$$\vI recorded it on a flash drive to get my old friend back after this story ends ... $$$$$$\vSo he hates me...$$\vAlso, due to the lack of most logic elements, it is a bit dull, which led to the fact that he sold travelers not only what will help for survival...
\vI see you have already picked up most bad effects… Do you want me to remove all of them for [COST] coins?
\vThat's nice… Now your soul is pure again ...
\vWell, as you want… Since you're so comfortable... I won't dissuade you...
\vThe whole secret is that you, as the Chosen One, will be able to stop the possible evil that is still sleeping in the bowels of these places...$$$$$$$$\vDestroy it - and you will open the way to freedom$$$$\vAnd it, presumably, lives in the very secret department of the basement$$$$\vIn the next room there is a cannon with which you can punch a hole there ... $$$$\vIt is in this place that there is a gap through which you can get there ... $$$$$\vThe problem of the Secret Department is that all known exits to it are either closed or bricked up ... $$$$$\vBut here for some reason they did not finish building… This is even in our favor...$$$$$$$$\v...$$\vWhat have I been entertaining myself with all this time?$$$/v / You know, when you're in complete silence, the only decent thing to do - these are heartfelt conversations with the inner self$$$$$$\vTrue, due to limited knowledge and life experience, topics for reasoning are often repeated...
\v...$$\vThe forbidden Zone is a legend that Ivan invented so that stupid laboratory assistants would be afraid to come here.$$$$$$\vI also used this idea to scare away the robots ... $$$$\v...$$\vAs they say "A fool always steps on the same rake twice"$$$$$\vAnd why the robots did not survive there, you can guess for yourself...
\vOooh ... $$\vI myself do not know what the secret department is and what it hides ... $$$$\vI can only assume that high technologies are buried there, that great minds of research institutes live there, and that evil is slowly awakening there ... $$$$$$$\vTherefore, you must break through there, find the source of possible troubles and eliminate it.$$$$$\vI hope you can do it...
\v...$$\vEverything is quite simple and clear ... $$$\vI can't risk my life to go there ... $$$$\vYou, as the Chosen One, have a better chance of survival in extreme conditions!$$$$\vYou literally went through fire and water ... $$$$\vYes, you will be able to handle any visible and invisible dangers of the secret department!$$$$$\v...$$\vAnd if you manage to die, I'll wait for someone else who can fulfill his destiny ... $$$$$\v...$$\vTherefore… I can't go on my own, nor can I go with you…
\v...No!$\vI'm not Vitalya to bargain with you!$$$\vI'll give you a free e-card which can record you studied part one floor...$$$$$$\vTheoretically it can help you to navigate in unknown environment...
\vAny good conversation sooner or later come to an end...$$$$\vWe must not tarry... Suddenly evil will Wake up before you get there?!$$$$$\vGo quickly there, while there is still a chance of salvation ... $$$$$\vJust find the balls nearby, load them into the cannon and break through the passage ... $$$$\vAnd there... and there - according to the circumstances...
