# Locate Steamworks library
# This module defines
# STEAMWORKS_LIBRARY, the name of the library to link against

#
# If a path is set in the SteamworksDIR environment variable it will check there
#
# This has been tested on OS X
# This may or may not with Linux - it should, but i think it could be broken easily
